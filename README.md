# ai-facial-recognition
This project is for me to attempt to use a ReactJS App with some machine learning thrown in in order to recognize faces.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Before you begin, you'll need...
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)

# To Run Locally...
Run the following command from the root directory...

* `npm install`
 * This will set up dependencies for the project.
* `npm start`
 * This will run the server locally.

# Notes
* The command `git update-index --skip-worktree clarifai.env` has been used to help ensure that changes to the file won't be requested to be stored into the repository.
